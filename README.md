## Part 1 - Random Graph Identification

For the first part of this assignment you will analyze randomly generated graphs and determine which algorithm created them.

## Part 2 - Company Emails

For the second part of this assignment you will be workking with a company's email network where each node corresponds to a person at the company, and each edge indicates that at least one email has been sent between two people.

The network also contains the node attributes Department and ManagementSalary.

Department indicates the department in the company which the person belongs to, and ManagementSalary indicates whether that person is receiving a management position salary.

### Part 2A - Salary Prediction

Using network G, identify the people in the network with missing values for the node attribute ManagementSalary and predict whether or not these individuals are receiving a management position salary.

### Part 2B - New Connections Prediction

For the last part of this assignment, you will predict future connections between employees of the network. The future connections information has been loaded into the variable future_connections. The index is a tuple indicating a pair of nodes that currently do not have a connection, and the Future Connection column indicates if an edge between those two nodes will exist in the future, where a value of 1.0 indicates a future connection.
